HyperThought Data/MetaData Uploading program

## How to install ##

Best practice would be to create a virtual environment for python.
  ```lang-console
  conda create -n easybake python=3.8 tqdm requests
  pip install pyside2
  pip install dataclasses-json
  ```
  or

  ```lang-console
  python3 -m venv easybake tqdm requests
  source easybake/bin/activate
  pip install pyside2
  pip install dataclasses-json
  ```


1. git clone into the directory.

  ```lang-console
  git clone https://www.github.com/bluequartzsoftware/EasyBake
  ```

2. Open up terminal and execute (if you already have not installed the dependencies from above)

```lang-console
pip install PySide2 tqdm requests
```

## How to Run ##

From a command prompt within the EasyBake directory (shown using an Anaconda prompt on a Unix Terminal)

```lang-console
(easybake) [user@host.com:EasyBake]% python main.py
```
