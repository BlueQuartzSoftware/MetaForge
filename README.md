# MetaForge #

HyperThought Data/MetaData Uploading program

## How to install ##

1. This assumes that you have git and a conda environment manager running on your system.  We currently recomend the conda-forge python distribution, but others will likely work.  

git clone into the directory. 

  ```lang-console
  git clone https://www.github.com/bluequartzsoftware/MetaForge
  ```

Now create an conda environment 
  ```lang-console
  cd MetaForge
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```


2. Open up terminal and execute. 

From a command prompt within the MetaForge directory (shown using an conda prompt on a Unix Terminal)

```lang-console
(metaforge) [user@host.com:MetaForge]% python MetaForge.py
```
